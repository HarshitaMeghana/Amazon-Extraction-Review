Description

This package allows you to search for products on Amazon and extract some useful information (ratings, number of comments).

I wrote a French blog post about it here
Requirements

    Python 3
    pip3

Installation

pip3 install -U amazonscraper

Command line tool amazon2csv.py

After the package installation, you can use the amazon2csv.py command in the terminal.

After passing a search request to the command (and an optional maximum number of products), it will return the results as csv :

amazon2csv.py --keywords="Python programming" --maxproductnb=2

Product title,Rating,Number of customer reviews,Product URL,Image URL,ASIN

You can also pass a search url (if you added complex filters for example), and save it to a file :

amazon2csv.py --url="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=python+scraping" > output.csv

You can then open it with your favorite spreadsheet editor (and play with the filters) :

snapshot amazon2csv

amazon2csv.py --help

Using the amazonscraper Python package

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import amazonscraper

results = amazonscraper.search("Python programming", max_product_nb=2)

for result in results:
    print("{}".format(result.title))
    print("  - ASIN : {}".format(result.asin))
    print("  - {} out of 5 stars, {} customer reviews".format(result.rating, result.review_nb))
    print("  - {}".format(result.url))
    print("  - Image : {}".format(result.img))
    print()

print("Number of results : %d" % (len(results)))

Which will output :

Docker

You can use the amazon2csv tool with the Docker image

You may execute :

docker run -it --rm thibdct/amazon2csv --keywords="Python programming" --maxproductnb=2
ðŸ¤˜ The easy way ðŸ¤˜

I also built a bash wrapper to execute the Docker container easily.

Install it with :

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tducret/amazon-scraper-python/master/amazon2csv \
> /usr/local/bin/amazon2csv && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/amazon2csv

You may replace /usr/local/bin with another folder that is in your $PATH

Check that it works :

On the first execution, the script will download the Docker image, so please be patient

amazon2csv --help
amazon2csv --keywords="Python programming" --maxproductnb=2

You can upgrade the app with :

amazon2csv --upgrade

and even uninstall with :

amazon2csv --uninstall

TODO

    If no product was found with the CSS selectors, it may be a new Amazon page style => change user agent and get the new page. Loop on all the user agents and check all the CSS selectors again
    Find a way to get the products without css selectors
